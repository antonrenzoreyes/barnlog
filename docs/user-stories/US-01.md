# US-01: Add Animals

## Epic
- EPIC-01

## User Story
As a barn user, I can add a new animal with required details and optional metadata so the animal can be tracked in the system.

## Field Requirements
- `name` (required)
- `species` (required: `goat` or `pig`)
- `customTag` (optional)
- `birthdate` (optional, `YYYY-MM-DD`)
- `photo` (optional, uploaded first and linked by `photo_id`)

## Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] User can create a new animal with `name` and `species`.
- [ ] `name` is required and cannot be blank.
- [ ] `species` only accepts `goat` or `pig`.
- [ ] `customTag` can be omitted.
- [ ] `birthdate` can be omitted; when provided, it must be a valid `YYYY-MM-DD` date.
- [ ] `photo` can be omitted; when provided, the flow uploads a file first and links the returned `photo_id` when creating the animal.
- [ ] Invalid input returns validation errors and does not create an animal.
- [ ] After successful creation, the animal appears in the animals list.

## Implementation Notes
- Backend creation API task: `#22`
- Frontend add-animal flow task: `#29`
- Photo upload API task: `#30`
